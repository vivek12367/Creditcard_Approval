# **💳 Credit Card Approval Prediction**

## 📌 Overview  
This project predicts **credit card approvals** based on applicant details such as **income, employment status, and credit history**. The model is trained using a **Gradient Boosting Classifier** and deployed as a **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.  


## 🚀 Key Features  
✔ **End-to-End ML Pipeline** (Preprocessing → Training → Deployment)  
✔ **Feature Engineering** (Outlier Removal, Encoding, Normalization)  
✔ **Gradient Boosting Classifier + SMOTE for Imbalance Handling**  
✔ **AWS S3 for Secure Model Storage**  
✔ **Interactive Streamlit Web App for Predictions**

## 🛠 ML Pipeline & Feature Engineering  
The **end-to-end pipeline** is built using **Scikit-Learn Pipelines** to ensure efficiency and automation.

### ✅ **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- **Outlier Removal** (IQR-based filtering)  
- **Missing Value Imputation**  
- **Categorical Encoding** (OneHotEncoder & OrdinalEncoder)  
- **Feature Scaling** (MinMaxScaler)  

### ✅ **2. Model Training**  
- **Algorithm**: Gradient Boosting Classifier  
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE oversampling  
- **Feature Selection**: Based on SHAP importance  

### ✅ **3. Deployment**  
- **Model stored in AWS S3**  
- **Predictions served via Streamlit Web App**
